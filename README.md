# The Dreamy Nails Website

Website for The Dreamy Nails, a client with a home studio for manicures and nail art.

While currently under development, this is a professional website for a real business, and the initial version will be deployed in the near future once content is more complete.

## Roadmap (roughly prioritised)
* finish adding homepage content
* Integrate Instagram API for showing recent work
* implement missing content pages (FAQ, About)
* SEO optimisations
* ---- soft release and deploy ----
* extract more components (List&List.Item? Text?)
* v2 design & branding updates
  * styling for desktop breakpoint (1200px)
* integrate booking system
* integrate shopify
* Implement end-to-end tests
* Start documenting components in storybook

## Getting started

For local development:

```
npm run dev
```

## Discussion & decisions made

### Styling

I decided to use TailwindCSS, purely because I normally avoid it as much as possible. I've always found it slower than writing raw CSS, personally, and I dislike the mess it turns your markup into, but in order to give it a fair appraisal I need to become fluent with it as "it's faster once you're used to it" is one of the main arguments for its use.
